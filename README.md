## Commands

### init
`rally-app-builder init myNewApp`
Creating a new Rally App is as easy as using init. The init command creates you an App for use inside of Rally.

The init command takes a few parameters.
*name : The first is the name for your new App.
    *`rally-app-builder init myNewApp`
*sdk_version(optional) : The version of the SDK your App will be created against.
    *`rally-app-builder init myNewApp 2.0p2`
*server(optional) : The server you want the debug file to point to. The command below will create a new App using version 2.0p2 and pointing to the server myownRally.com
    * `rally-app-builder init myNewApp 2.0p2 https://myOwnRally.com`


### clone
`rally-app-builder clone RallyApps StoryBoard`

Most Rally Apps are created by using an existing App as a template.
By using the rally-app-builder clone command you can get a copy of the existing App without installing the Git CLI.
This command makes some changes to the config file so that we can tell which App you based your work on. As we determine
which apps you are most interested in customizing we take that as input on ways to improve the existing catalog App.
